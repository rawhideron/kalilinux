# kali-linux-docker

a docker container running a customizable full Kali Linux distribution.

The build script lets you chose 

- which remote access software you want to use (vnc, x2go, rdp)
- which network you want to use  (host, bridge)
- which Kali Packages to install (core, default everything and so on)
- which Desktop environment to use ( xfce, kde, gnome, mate etc.)

## how to build

Download all the files into a subdirectory on your linux docker host, e.g. /home/marc/kali-linux docker
then cd into that directory and run

    sudo ./build

The build script then asks you for all the options and builds the image, creates the container
and starts it. So in a nutshell, the complete command sequence in a linux shell to install on a Debian or Ubuntu Linux would be:

    apt update
    apt install git
    git clone https://github.com/onemarcfifty/kali-linux-docker.git
    cd kali-linux-docker
    sudo ./build

## how to use

You can now connect to the container by launching your favourite remote access software. The default ports defined in the script are as follows:

- RDP on port 13389
- ssh / x2goserver on port 20022
- vnc on port 5908 / display :8

All user names are `kaliuser` and all passwords are `onemarcfifty`
